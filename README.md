# uwo-automatic-course-enroller

You don't need to constantly sit on the timetable page anymore, constantly refreshing hoping that space opens up in a course you want/need really badly. This program automatically
scrapes the UWO timetable every 10 seconds and alerts users when their desired courses are no longer full. In addition, there are
optional features for automtic enrollment and swapping once there is course availablility. If these options are not selected, users
will only recieve alerts.
