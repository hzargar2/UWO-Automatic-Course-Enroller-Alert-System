# uwo-automatic-course-enroller

You don't need to constantly sit on the timetable page anymore, constantly refreshing hoping that space opens up in a course you want/need really badly. This program automatically
scrapes the UWO timetable every 10 seconds and alerts users when their desired courses are no longer full. In addition, there are
optional features for automatic enrollment and swapping once there is course availability. If these options are not selected, users
will only receive alerts.

The user is responsible for making sure that usage of this program does not violate any of the university's policies. The user assumes
full responsibility for using this software and the author will not be held responsible for any consequences or damages. Use at your own
risk. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, do not use this software.
